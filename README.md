Bootstrap is the most widely used design framework, supporting the development of modern & responsive HTML5 and CSS3 based websites, and WordPress powers the majority of modern websites.
Bootstrap significantly reduces development time by ensuring your website layouts are responsive and mobile friendly, while WordPress makes it very easy to manage website content.
The problem is that most people find it overwhelming to learn Bootstrap and WordPress on their own.
